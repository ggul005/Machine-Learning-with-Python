Merry Christmas to you!

We hope you all have enjoyed your time with family and/or friends. It has been a tremendous year for us, I hope it has been so for you as well. Last year our little one has grown from a little baby into a cute little toddler showing signs of true personality. Boy, she has kept us on our toes! Susan has started working part time at Alfriston College again, but is happy to have been offered a job at Westlake Boys High School starting early next year. We are hoping that this will allow for a much more relaxed family life, more sporty time for Thomas, and a hopefully pneumonia free year :)

We wish you a happy new year and hope to be able to catch up with you some time next year.

Happy holidays
Susan, Thomas and Clara
