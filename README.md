# Machine Learning with Python

Here I present machine learning codes written in Python from scratch, i.e.
without invoking specialized libraries, such as scikit-learn, tensor flow etc.
Most of them are based on my solutions to exercises from Stanford machine learning course
at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
